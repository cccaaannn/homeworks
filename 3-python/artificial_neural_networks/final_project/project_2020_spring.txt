CMP5133- Artificial Neural Networks
2019-2020 Spring Term Project

Important Notes

- Project report submission deadline: May 28, 23:59 (Strict)

- Submit your report through itslearning as a single PDF file. You should use the attached file as report template. The source code will be given in the Appendix section of the report.

- This is a group project. Therefore, you should work in groups of 2. Individual implementations or more than 2 students will NOT be accepted.

---------------------

Grading of Project

Report: 35%
Quality of Work: 40%
Presentation: 25%

---------------------

Important Instructions 

- The presentations will be held between June 1 and 7 during the class and some extra hours. I will later announce the exact presentation dates.

- Choose one or more datasets from Kaggle, UCI machine learning repository or any other internet source. You are also allowed to use a dataset belonging to the company or organization you work for if you have the required permissions. 

- The dataset(s) you will use in your projects should not be older than 2015. 

- You should use at least of the deep neural network architecture such as LSTM-RNN, CNN, GAN, Autoencoders, etc.

- Your experiments should be presented in a comparative manner, i.e. not an application of a single method to a single dataset. For example, comparing multiple deep neural network algorithms under different conditions, comparing deep neural network algorithm to a traditional algorithm, comparing different settings of a single deep neural network algorithm, etc.

- Implementation should be done at Python or R. You may use any packages, functions, classes, etc.

---------------------

Project Report Instructions

In the project report, you should:

- Divide the report into 6 sections: (1) Introduction, (2) Dataset Description, (3) Methods, (4) Experimental Results, (5) Conclusions, (6) Appendix.

- The source code will be given in (6) Appendix section of the report.

- Clearly define the aim of the project in introduction section. You may use the methods we have covered until now this semester or any other machine learning method. 

- Give a review of the related works about your project topics.

- Briefly summarize the methods you have implemented in your project with your own words. 

- Give the experimental results with tables and/or figures. Make comments and compare the algorithms with proper evaluation metrics depending on the structure of your problem and dataset.

---------------------

Submission Instructions

- Submit your report through itslearning as a single PDF file. You should use the attached file as report template. The source code will be given in the Appendix section of the report.

- Only one person out of each group should submit the project. The file name should include all group membersâ€™ student names in the format
{STUDENT NAME} and {STUDENT NAME}.rar
