Chipmaker Nvidia was a major beneficiary of the crypto-boom last year. But by now, the party is over and the hangover is starting to set in. In its disappointing earnings report Thursday, Nvidia executives outlined a drop in revenue for the current quarter based on lack of demand for its gaming cards. Cryptocurrency mining had fueled demand for those chips late last year. But that has all but dried up as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies' prices nosedived and "mining" for many of those is no longer profitable.These chips are now being sold on secondary markets, adding to surplus inventory, which weighed the company's fourth-quarter guidance. On a call with analysts following the report Thursday, CEO Jensen Huang said it could take up to two quarters to move through that additional inventory.
Taking pictures on your smartphone in the dark is usually a lousy experience. The photos often come out dull, discolored, or blurry, unless you use a flash, in which case you're stuck with an artificial shininess and red eyes. Without a tripod and the know-how to manually adjust your phone's camera settings, capturing a dark scene that looks clear and authentic is tough. That's why the latest camera update for Google's Pixel phones feels so incredible. Google's just-launched Night Sight feature makes taking bright, crisp photos in the dark as easy as waiting a few extra moments after you press the shutter button. The app essentially takes a burst of sharp, dark photos and merges them together, while automatically rebalancing the colors to make them more accurate. After a couple evenings of testing, some of the results truly amazed me.
fuck you you mother fucker
