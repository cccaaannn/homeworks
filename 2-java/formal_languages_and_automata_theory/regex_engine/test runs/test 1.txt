The term Byzantine or Byzantium originated from the ancient Greek city state Byzantion.

The term Roman originates from Greek Romoi, it is plural of Romios, which means from Rome, it was used as Rum by Seljuks.  

Romans or people of the Eastern Roman Empire did not call themselves as Byzantine.

Remember that some Roman Emperors, such as Diocletian, r. 208-305, Constantine/Konstantinos r. 
306-337, Constantine II/Konstantinos II  r. 337-361, Valentinian r. 364-375 & Valens r. 364-378, and Theodosius r. 
379-395 struggled to establish political unification. 
Of these emperors Constantine the Great achieved this, but did not last very long. 
The following emperors ruled the vast territories of the Roman Empire by appointing co-rulers that this brought about the division of the Empire as West and East. 
When the Western Roman Empire ended 476, the Roman Empire continued to live in the Eastern part.  

 

Byzantine Empire dominated Balkan Peninsula, Northern Middle East, Mediterranean Coastline, and North Africa.
